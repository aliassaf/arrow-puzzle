# Arrow Puzzle Solver

A solver for the Arrow Puzzle in the [Exponential Idle](https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/) game.

The puzzle is similar to the popular [Lights Out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)) game but has more light states (4, 6) and level shapes (squares, hexagons).

This implementation solves it with linear algebra with modulo arithmetic using [numpy](https://numpy.org/).
